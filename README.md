### Animal Species Prediction System Using SSD and MobileNetV2

---

## **Animal Species Prediction System**

This project aims to develop an **Animal Species Prediction System** that uses the **Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD)** combined with the **MobileNetV2 architecture** for real-time wildlife detection and classification.

### **Project Overview**

The system is designed to automatically detect and classify various animal species from images or video feeds collected via wildlife cameras or drones. The project leverages **deep learning** models, specifically the SSD object detection architecture with MobileNetV2 as the feature extractor, to provide efficient real-time detection with minimal computational overhead.

### **Workflow**

1. **Data Collection**  
   Wildlife images and videos are collected from drones or stationary cameras in natural habitats.

2. **Data Storage**  
   The raw images/videos are stored in cloud storage solutions such as AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage for scalability.

3. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Irrelevant or poor-quality images are filtered out.
   - Labeled data is generated using annotation tools like **LabelMe** or **CVAT**.

4. **Data Augmentation**  
   Data augmentation techniques (e.g., rotation, scaling, and brightness adjustment) are applied to improve the dataset's diversity and robustness.

5. **Model Training**  
   - The SSD model with **MobileNetV2** as the backbone is trained using **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch**.
   - The model is fine-tuned on a dataset of wildlife species, with localization loss and confidence loss used for optimization.

6. **Model Deployment**  
   The trained model is deployed on an inference server or on edge devices like drones or cameras to enable real-time species detection in new images.

7. **Real-Time Inference**  
   The model processes images from wildlife cameras/drones to detect and classify animals in real-time with confidence scores.

8. **Continuous Improvement**  
   A feedback loop is established to collect new data, refine annotations, and periodically retrain the model to improve its accuracy and adaptability.

### **Installation**

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/animal-species-prediction.git
   ```

2. Set up the Python environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd animal-species-prediction
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download or upload your annotated dataset into the appropriate directory (`/data` folder).

4. Run the training script (ensure the dataset is correctly configured):
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

### **Usage**

1. **Inference on New Images:**
   After training, run the inference script to classify new images:
   ```bash
   python inference.py --input_path /path/to/your/image.jpg
   ```

2. **Real-time Detection:**
   For real-time detection using a camera feed:
   ```bash
   python realtime_detection.py
   ```
